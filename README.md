# AMPL-project
============

This is a primal project related to course MATH 535 ([Syllabus](https://science.iit.edu/sites/science/files/elements/am/courses/Syllabus_Math_535.pdf)), however the AMPL (A mathematical Programming Language) is the main objective. 


[AMPL](http://www.ampl.com) is a comprehensive and powerful algebraic modeling language for linear and nonlinear optimization problems, in discrete or continuous variables.

Developed at Bell Laboratories, AMPL lets you use common notation and familiar concepts to formulate optimization models and examine solutions, while the computer manages communication with an appropriate solver.

AMPL's flexibility and convenience render it ideal for rapid prototyping and model development, while its speed and control options make it an especially efficient choice for repeated production runs.

* pick among those SR values whose 3pm-4pm interval is majority T1 weather conditions
CAUTION: 	too many? 3pm - 4pm with no majority
			Important weather type(for SR) that are too short

* P[ weather = T2 | weather = T1]=?
at some timestamp 3pm & (some date range)
pick data with majority T1 for 2pm-3pm & with that count data with majority T2 for 3pm-4pm

* example: P[ next hour is cloudy | current hour is clear] = ?

INPUT:
	1. Time period: 3pm - 4pm with date Â± 20
	2. weather conditions 

PROCESS:
	pick SR value for all data points (historical actual values) with same time and weather condition

OUT: 
	Prob.[]

CALCULATE:
	counts for minutes to minutes weather
	take the 60th piece of the weather to get the hour-to-hour prob.


P[W=W2|W=W1] = (#mins * (W1->W2))/(#mins * (W1->W1) + #mins * (W1->W2))
